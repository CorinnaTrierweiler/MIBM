# Simple functions on vectors 

In this section, we illustrate calculations with a single vector (element by element) and the recycling rule.


```{r}
visits1 <-  c(12, 2, 45, 75, 65, 11, 3)
visits2 <- c(23, 4, 5, 78, 12, 0, 200)

total <- visits1 + visits2
total

total.p2 <- total^2
total.p2

apples <- 15
bananas <- 60
my.fruits <- apples + bananas
my.fruits

l3 <- c(12, 34, 50)
l2 <- c(10, 3)
tt <- l3 + 5 
tt

ltotal <- l3+l2 # recycling!!!
```


```{r}
ages <- c(28, 33, 39, 56, 34, 45, 27, 40)
ages
max(ages)
sum(ages)
length(ages)

ages <- c(28, 33,39,56,34,45, 27,40, NA)
mean(ages, na.rm=TRUE)

# for help on a command, simply type ? in front of it
?mean

```
